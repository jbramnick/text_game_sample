Combat (40 xp) - Allows the Player to fight NPC's in the Dungeon. When the Player is in the same room as an NPC, he/she will have the opportunity
to fight with them in a turn-based system. Each NPC has health and a power level, which will determine how much damage will be dealt to the 
Player when the NPC attacks, and vice versa. Weapons (Melee and Guns(which require ammo, separate Items)) will be available to the Player to deal
more damage to enemies.

Hunger(15xp): The player will grow more hungry as time passes. They can refill the food in their belly by eating food items. 
This adds a limit to the number of turns that the player has to win the game. If they do not win the game before all the food runs 
out then they will die.
