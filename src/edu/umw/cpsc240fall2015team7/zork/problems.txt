The secondary names are not working.(seems to work for normal items)
Reload does not work.
Light does not work. (if you have a light it automatically makes it light in the room. Regardless of if it is on or not.) 
When there are more then one Npc in the room only the one that you are fighting will attack you. 
Need a way to check the ammo state of a gun.
