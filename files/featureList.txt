Combat (40 xp) - Allows the Player to fight NPCs in the Dungeon. 
When the Player is in the same room as an NPC, he/she will have the opportunity
to fight with them in a turn-based system. Each NPC has health and a 
power level, which will determine how much damage will be dealt to the 
Player when the NPC attacks, and vice versa. Weapons (Melee and Guns
(which require ammo, separate Items)) will be available to the Player to deal
more damage to enemies.

due to the fact that zombies move every time you move it can be hard to find a zombie but one initially spawns in the dark room to the north of start room


-----------------------------------------------------------
Hunger(15xp): The player will grow more hungry as time passes. They can refill the food in their belly by eating food items. 
This adds a limit to the number of turns that the player has to win the game. If they do not win the game before all the food runs 
out then they will die.

To find food, first follow steps in Locked Doors to unlock the door to the
south of the StartRoom. Then, from StartRoom, go south twice (s,s).
Here, you will find a Cheeseburger which you may eat.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Locked Doors(10xp): Doors can be locked or unlocked at hydration. They can be unlocked by the player using a key or by talking 
with an NPC (see Npc).

To test this, take the torch in the StartRoom, go north once, use the torch,
take the Key (you may have to defeat a zombie in this room first), then go
south agaoin to the StartRoom and type "use Key". This unlocks the door to 
the south.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Light(15xp) - Rooms can be dark at hydration or become dark due to a 
changeLightEvent. While you are in a room that is dark you cannot do 
anything other than exit or use a Light item. Any enemies in the Room will 
be able to attack you.

To test Light, take the torch in the StartRoom, go north once, 
and type "use torch".

Verbose (2xp) - This toggles the exit text for room descriptions. 
Typing "verbose" toggles this on or off.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Internal Clock (5xp) - Time will pass when the Player drops or takes an item,
"looks" in a room, moves to a different room,performs an ItemSpecificCommand,
or engages in combat with an Npc (per turn).
Passage of time affects the Player's hunger and activities of Npc's (described below).


-----------------------------------------------------------
Npc's (30xp) - Np's exist in the dungeon and can be declared in the .zork file.
They have their own health, power, and may be talked to for various effects.
Npc's may or may not be aggresive toward the Player, and be able to move on
their own through the dungeon, designated in the .zork. In supplemental.zork,
Zombies are the only Npc's which are able to move.
As well, the first type of Npc listed in the .zork will have a chance to be spawned 
in a random room when a PassTimeEvent occurs.

To see an Npc open a locked door, from the StartRoom, first take the torch,
then go north once, take the key, go south once, and type 'use key' to unlock 
the door to the south. 
That being done, go (s,s,w,w) then talk to Socrates, and answer with 'Idk'.

To trade with an Npc, from the StartRoom, talk to Bob, and say 'yes'. 
He will then give you a Shotgun. Alternatively, you may say 'no' for no effect,
or, 'screw you bob' and he will shoot you.

Another trade opportunity is, after speaking to Socrates, go up from StairwayToHeaven to Olympus, talk to Herakles, and answer with 'human'.
He will then give you a Lightsaber.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Player Advancement (10xp) - The player will have a defence level and an attack level. The attack level control how accurate you are. 
When you attack in anyway the combat engine will decide if you hit or not. You will be more likely to hit as your attack level goes up. 
The defence level will increase as you take damage. The more damage you take the higher your level will be. A higher defence level will lower 
the amount damage you  will take from a hit. Advancement is on an xp system. As you cause damage to npcs the damage will be added to the attack xp.
As the player takes damage the defence xp goes up. The reasoning for this is as you successfuly kill things it gets easier and as you get hurt you
are more motivated to dodge.
